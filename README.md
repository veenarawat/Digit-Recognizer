# Digit Recognizer
In this work, I used SVM(Support Vector Machine) classifiers for handwritten digit recognition. According to input variables, the classifier was trained and tested. The algorithm outputs an optimal hyper plane which categorizes new example. In this work, using the converted grayscale image as input, approximately 98% handwritten digit recognition accuracy was obtained in the MNIST database.
# Introduction
In recent times, character or digit recognition technology
has been driven by the increasing demand of converting a
large amount of printed or handwritten information to a digital
format. Billions of checks, mail correspondence (including pin
codes), etc. required large number of humans to process it and
convert them to digital format. The process was time consuming,
error prone and very tiresome, motivating the development
of digit recognition systems.Character recognition is a very
difficult problem, due to the great variability in writing styles,
that is the same character can be written in different sizes
and angles. In this paper, we discuss classification systems
for handwritten digit recognition using four different fea- ture
sets and SVM classifiers In this paper, we discuss classification
systems for handwritten digit recognition using four different
fea- ture sets and SVM classifiers In this paper, we discuss
classification systems for handwritten digit recognition using
four different fea- ture sets and SVM classifiers There are
many applications for handwriting recognition. There are
many techniques that have been developed to recognize the
handwriting. One of them is Optical Character Recognition
(OCR). OCR will read text from scanned document and translating
the images into a form that computer can manipulate
it. In this paper we will use Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classification algorithm to recognize the handwritten digits.
